## Project Description

### Inspiration

We know that research is necessary for many reasons like building Knowledge, Comprehending New Trends and Understanding Issues. But it is very hard to get the data for a research study. I faced a hard time with my research about Social Media Issues a while ago. It's very difficult to get data and that too getting useful and quality data is the next level. So I built this Effect Research Dapp to help all those people who are doing research to make the world a better place.

A User can create a research study and submit it to the effect network and They will get the data from a global workforce for their research. They can view and download that data.

### Summary

EffectResearch helps students, scholars and researchers to get quality data for their ongoing research.
